# RGB-LED-Audio-Visualizer

This project visualizes any audio passed to it via a standard 3.5mm audio jack. See [my personal site](https://robbieculkin.wordpress.com) for videos and a tutorial. A lot of this was written at the start of my freshman year at SCU, when the extent of my C/C++ knowledge came from an intro to programming course and the Arduino starter kit. In 2016 I reorganized and cleaned somethings up for readabilty.

* master: What I currently run on my display at home. Usually the most up-to-date
* full-scale-tower-master: an adaptation of master for a commissioned 4-foot tower
* wave-master: an adaptation of master setup to run on the BreadBro Wave
